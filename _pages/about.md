My name is Jonas Beachy and I am a PhD student at the University of Washington in the Mechanical Engineering department. I work in both the [MACS](https://macslab.xyz/) lab and the [Boeing Advanced Research Center](https://www.barc.uw.edu/) where I focus on robotics and applied control theory.


This website has many purposes. One, of course, is to showcase any future research and publications and display my CV. Another is to serve as a personal repository. The [projects](https://jsbeachy.github.io/projects/) page contains larger projects that were done either in classes or as a passion project. They vary in magnitude by tend to be more significant. The [blog](https://jsbeachy.github.io/projects/) page will consist primarily of smaller mathematical, control theory, or general knowledge curiosities that caught my interest. Both of these pages will contain things that a larger population may find interesting but primarily serve as a personal reminder of the content and projects I have done.

It's a lot easier to "relearn" something after a time if you have written a blog post previously on that same topic!
